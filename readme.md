In this program there are three programming codes.

The first program is to Write a function named parallel(). in this fuction when called, it outputs the effective resistance of a network of 2 or more resistors connected in parallel. It also accepst a list of numbers of any length.


The second function is named potential_divider(). This function takes two values as argument, a number that represents a voltage supply value and a list of numbers that represent resistance values of resistors connected in series. The function outputs the voltage drop across each resistor in in the resistor list. It also accepst a list of numbers of any length.


The third function is named temperature_check(). This functions accepts a single number, a patient's body temperature, and a single character, the unit of temperature. The function outputs whether the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal body temperature based on the number passed to the function.  The second value passed as argument should tell the function whether the condition should calculated in degrees celcius or degrees fahrenheit. An appropriate message is written to the screen with the result. This code uses if statements and lists to complete the program. This code also takes into consideration if the user inputs a lower case or upper case letter f or C and it will still function as intended.


These codes were written for the purpose of the INTERNET OF THINGS CLASS LABORATORY ASSIGNMENT.
